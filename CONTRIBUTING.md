# How to contribute

We'd really love to accept your patches and contributions to this application. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

1.  Sign up for GitHub at https://github.com/ if you donâ€™t already have an account.
1.  (Optional) Set up an SSH key to [connect to your account using SSH].
1.  (Preffered) [Add a GPG signing key to your account].

1.  (Optional) [Fork the repository]. This creates a copy of the repository in your account.
1.  Create a work folder on your workstation. The rest of this document assumes `~/work`, adjust as needed.
1.  [clone your copy of the repository] and add it to your local work folder. You may replace `dev-ritik` with your github username if using your own fork:
    ```
    cd ~/work
    git clone https://github.com/dev-ritik/Finsights-frontend.git
    cd Finsights
    ```
1.  To install depemdency run:
    ```sh

    ```

## (Optional) Configure git

Use the following commands to configure git:
```
# Make git clean up all the remote tags it creates when you delete remote branches
git config fetch.prune true
git config user.name <your-name> # Add --global to make this a global setting
git config user.email <you@your-email.com> # Can also be a global setting
# If you added a GPG signing key, run the following commands:
git config user.signingkey <keyid>
git config commit.gpgsign true
```
_Last 2 git config commands are recommended_

## Testing locally

    npm run start
    ```
